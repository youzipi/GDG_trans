1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,493


2
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:09,743
大家好
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:14,700
[啪啪啪]
papapa

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,226
谢谢
Thank you.

5
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,309
我真是受宠若惊
I have a cheering section.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,690
That's amazing.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,750
大家感觉怎么样
How's everybody doing?

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,850
觉得这次IO大会如何
Having a good I/O?

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,080
后面还会有几个分享
Just got a few more sessions to go.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,040
非常感谢各位来听我的分享
I'm glad that you made it out to this point.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,920
我叫 Timothy Jordan
I'm Timothy Jordan.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,730
今天我要讲的是Google的普适计算
And this is Ubiquitous Computing with Google.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,400
我们已经讨论了好多关于
Now, we've all been talking a lot lately

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,740
普适计算 物联网 可穿戴设备 等等
about ubiquitous computing, IOT, wearables, and so on.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,060
当然 我们还有好多要做的
And there's a lot we're going to be able to do together

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,870
帮助我们的用户和技术
to help make our users' relationship to technology

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,530
联系更紧密
better.

18
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,490
这是我们后面要做的
And this is the next step.

19
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,060
开始之前
Before I get started, please know

20
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,180
我想让你知道你可以反馈给我
that you can give me feedback.

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,010
IO主办方希望得到
The I/O overlords would like to know

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,640
你的看法 不管是大会本身 相关活动
what you think of this and similar content

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
还是某个具体的分享
and this session in particular.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,740
所以希望各位可以去app 或网页上
So just head over to the schedule

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,036
填一下这张反馈表
either on the app or the web.

26
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:58,160
谈谈你的想法
And tell us what you think.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,590


28
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,090
OK.

29
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,160
去年的这个时候 我就站在这个地方
So a year ago, I stood on this or a very similar stage.

30
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,320
当时 我分享了关于Google可穿戴设备相关的东西
And I talked to you about wearable computing with Google.

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,650
围绕这个论点
I put forth this idea of computing

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,030
我更多的从用户角度出发
that was more about the user than the device

33
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,490
而不是设备平台
that they carried.

34
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,290
我们探讨了它的启示
And we explored the implications of that and code design

35
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,240
并且通过分析NPC的问题探讨了代码设计相关问题
by looking at the problem through NPC,

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,115
简单 直接 关注空间
simple and straightforward, thinking about the space.

37
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,660


38
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,160
几天 我们将要实践这些观点
Today, we're going to take those ideas and build upon them.

39
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,417
接下来的时间 我们将深入的了解
In this session, we're going to take a deeper look

40
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:31,875
一些平台和工具
at the platforms and tools that can

41
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,750
通过它们 你可以让你的app实现多设备通用
make your app available on a variety of form factors,

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,450
不只是可穿戴设备 也可以是电视机
not just across wearables, but something that's available

43
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,430
车上 甚至是任何地方
on your television and in your car and someday,

44
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,900
even more places.

45
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,350
我们将会更深一步探讨这样的设计
And we'll explore the implications of that design

46
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,250
通过你现在检出和编译的代码
through code that you can check out and compile today.

47
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,080
现在进入正题
Let's get started.

48
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,980
首先 什么是普适计算
So first off, what is ubiquitous computing?

49
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,520
它是对 只要用户需要 
It's simply a fancy phrase for technology

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,370
他们随时随地可以访问 这种技术的概括
that's accessible to the user whenever and wherever they

51
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,780
want or need it.

52
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,260
这样
That's it.

53
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,320
比如骑车出行的时候
It could be outside when they're going for a bike ride

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,949
比如和朋友一起看搞笑视频的时候
or having some friends over to watch cat videos.

55
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,830
比如 在自驾短途旅行的时候
Or maybe it's time for a road trip.

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,050
你的用户很可能遇到这样的情形
Your users can be in any of those situations.

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,700
你不想让他们考虑他们需要什么样的设备
And you don't want them to have to think about what device they

58
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,870
才能访问你的服务
need to get to your service.

59
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,410
相反 你希望通过构建一个在他们身边现成的设备上可用的app
Instead, you're going to want an experience that presents itself

60
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,120
来为用户提供
to the user wherever it makes sense

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,702
随时随地满足用户需要的体验
by building an app that runs on whatever device

62
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:30,410
they have nearby.

63
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,000


64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
大部分人看到的计算机的演化都是
And many people look at the evolution of computing

65
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,050
像这样的
like this.

66
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,750


67
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,570
关注点总是在下一代设备
It's always about the next device-- big computer,

68
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,190
大型机 小型机 微型机
little computer, littler computer.

69
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,180
在这个进化路线的下一个是什么呢
What's the next thing in this linear progression?

70
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,310
实际上 现在以及今后
But really, our present and future

71
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,791
的发展非常不一样
looks quite a bit different.

72
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,500
更像这样 对不
It looks a lot more like this, right?

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,301
我们用不同的方式使用一堆技术
We use a bunch of technology in different ways.

74
00:02:58,301 --> 00:02:59,800
有时是同时使用
And we often do that simultaneously.

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,400


76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,270
实际上 这些设备的发展
In fact, the growth of these connected devices

77
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,870
是惊人的
is staggering.

78
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,215
尽管2020年的数字说法不同
Although the number in 2020 depends

79
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:12,230
可能有些差别
on who you ask-- it can be a little bit different--

80
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,195
但是绝对是超出你的想象的
It's always more than you can imagine.

81
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,820
我先不告诉大家图上的单位是多少
Now, I didn't throw out the units here.

82
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,070
有人能说一下你觉得单位是多少吗
Does anybody want to tell me what the units are there?

83
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,550


84
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,400
百万
Millions?

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,850
是十亿
It's billions.

86
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,665
到2020年将有2000亿设备
200 billion devices in 2020.

87
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,290
你也可以换个方式理解
And you can actually break this number down because 200 billion

88
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,900
因为2000亿有点太多抽象了
is sort of like this abstract number.

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,330
想像一下
Think of it this way.

90
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:40,340
到2020年 人均26台智能设备
26 smart devices for every human on the planet in 2020.

91
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,250
相 当 多
A lot.

92
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,310
但现在不是每个人都有26台智能设备
But not everybody has 26 in their pockets at the same time,

93
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,810
对吗
right?

94
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,420
不同行业之间差别很大
This is across industries.

95
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,270
但是想一下全世界现有的
But think about the number of devices that are going to be

96
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,145
和即将发行的设备
and already are in our world.

97
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,691


98
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,940
这是另一组数据
Here's another number for you.

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,742


100
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:03,010
这非常有意思 尤其是对我们来说
Hey, this is really interesting, especially for us, right?

101
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,630
高德纳公司预测 半数以上的物联网解决方案
Gartner has estimated half of IOT solutions

102
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,030
将在三年内涌现
will be from startups less than three years old.

103
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,460
半数
Half.

104
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,340
那么问题来了 你已经准备好
So the question really is, have you already started

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,430
投入到这场运动中了吗
building for this reality?

106
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,470
好消息是这并不是非常难 
The good news is it's not that hard to deal with, not as hard

107
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,280
至少不像它看上去那么难
as it might seem.

108
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,260
新功能的爆发式增长取决于
The explosion in form factors is manageable by having

109
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,790
一个强大的以可扩展性为方向的核心平台
a strong core platform that lends itself to extensibility.

110
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,280
你可以少浪费点时间关心多平台问题
So you can think less about a new project for each new device

111
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,205
把精力放在为新功能
and more about a versatile solution

112
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:39,120
设计通用的实现方案
that you can extend for new form factors

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,940
让他们变得可用
as they become available.

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,040
这些平台可以帮助你 现在已经有了
And these platforms that help you, they exist today.

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,760
给大家展示一个例子
I'm going to show you a working example in a bit.

116
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,550
在编码之前
But before we dig into some code,

117
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,710
这是它的逻辑结构
this is what it looks like logically.

118
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,640
传统的多平台支持形式
Now, the traditional approach to supporting different devices

119
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,590
是为每种设备和平台构建一个app
is to make an app for each device and platform

120
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,995
以便让用户使用
as they become available and adopted by users.

121
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:05,080


122
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,560
像不像
Like my animation?

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,960
几乎就是单独为每一个设备
This has typically meant a new project

124
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,210
做开发和支持
for each and every device developed and supported

125
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,610
independently.

126
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,510
疯了吧
Just crazy.

127
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,110
讽刺的是 我们开发者已经对这种情况
And the ironic thing is that we as developers are already

128
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,510
习以为常了
thinking about this experience as part

129
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,900
觉得这是跨平台开发中很自然的一部分
of a single whole experience for the user across devices.

130
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,900
这种分别进行开发的方式其实是很蠢的
It's just silly to approach these as separate projects.

131
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,440
相反 你应该好好看一下
Instead, you want to take the longer lens view.

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,670
如果在每一类设备上的
Think about having a view into your service from each

133
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,090
是视图
and every device that makes sense.

134
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,000
模型和控制器在中央设备
Your model and controller are on a central device

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,020
或者在云上
or in the cloud.

136
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,495
这样的话 可穿戴设备 智能家居
But then the wearable, in the living room,

137
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,950
车载设备 通过视图访问服务
in the car's a different view into that service.

138
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,160
这就回到了普适计算的定义上来了
And this is the definition of ubiquitous computing

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,040
对吗
again, right?

140
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
这就是 你的服务
It's where your service is available

141
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,246
可以随时随地的访问
anywhere and everywhere.

142
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:55,620
你和你的service
Now, each of you and your service

143
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,090
需要做个区分 对吗
is going to differ slightly, right?

144
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,340
在手机上何在车载设备商
It's going to look a little bit different on the wrist

145
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,730
应该有些区别
than it will in the car.

146
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,750
这就是你要花时间考虑的了
And that's what you want to spend your time on.

147
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,830
你不许需要浪费时间
You don't want to have to spend your time on figuring out

148
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,590
解决兼容性问题
the glue in between all these things.

149
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,140


150
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,100
下面我们直接看一下最佳实践的例子
So what we'll do is we'll jump right into best practices

151
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,520
然后我们再来总结一下这类经验
here so that we can think about how to conceptualize

152
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,830
that experience.

153
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,020
人们再也不用坐在桌子前
And people no longer need to sit at a desk

154
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,040
才能享受科技的便利
to get the benefits of technology.

155
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,820
我们提供的体验远远超出了
Experiences that we build can do more than just

156
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,510
这类用途 对吗
allow for that usage, right?

157
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,160
我刚才说过 人们可以在任何地方
As I've been saying, they can assume that usage

158
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
任何时间 使用
throughout the day and in the world.

159
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,530
他们不止能使用我们生活中
They can do more than just work nicely

160
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,400
已经有的技术
with existing technology in our lives.

161
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,550
还能无缝地在他们之间切换
They can work seamlessly across all of it.

162
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,490
现在 记住刚才提到的东西 下面有一些最佳实践
Now, with that in mind, these best practices

163
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,880
可以帮助我们理清楚
will help us navigate the issues, big and small,

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,660
如何才能这样开发 一些大大小小的注意点
that we develop in this way.

165
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,525
有一点需要注意的是
And a note about these best practices

166
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,420
它们可以给你提供的指导
is that they're guidelines that apply

167
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,110
不仅是单个设备上的体验
to your experience on each device

168
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,400
还有多平台上提供更好的体验
as well as the greater experience across all devices,

169
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,700
后者也是最佳实践的一个判断标准
which is a great litmus test for best practices in this area.

170
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,399
同时在宏观和微观层面
And make them great for ubiquitous computing

171
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,190
考虑如何让他们的普适计算
when you're thinking about both the smaller

172
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,750
做得更好
picture and the bigger picture across everything

173
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,560
at the same time.

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,470
第一点很常见 简单
The first one is sort of obvious, simple.

175
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,940
考虑一下这种场景
Now, think about it this way.

176
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,800
用户体验要求做到非常简单
The user experience should be so simple

177
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,500
简单到毫不费力 就像魔法一样
that it feels effortless, almost magical.

178
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,070
长期来看 用户更倾向于简单和稳定
In the long run, users always prefer

179
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,070
而不是功能的质量
simplicity and reliability over quantity of features.

180
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,250
不管你是解决用户的什么问题
Whatever user problem you solve, make

181
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,010
一定要牢牢记住这一点
sure to address that really well.

182
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,690
更不要做反其道而行的事
And never get in the way of that solution.

183
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,180
消息应用是个很好的例子
A great example of this is a messaging app.

184
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,510
我非常喜欢Android Wear上的消息通知
I love messaging on Android Wear.

185
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,330
我收到一条消息
I get a message.

186
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,920
然后我可以语音回复
And I can reply by voice.

187
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,810
非常的简单直接
It's so intuitive and simple.

188
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,020
就是很自然
It just makes sense.

189
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,130
第二点是 情景模式
The next one is contextual.

190
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,830
关注情境其实就是关注需要的
Now, being contextual is really about being relevant.

191
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,220
把时间 地点 甚至是用户参与的活动考虑在内
Take into account the time, the location, and even the activity

192
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,510
然后随时随地为用户
the user's involved in to provide them

193
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,540
提供最需要的
with the most useful experience wherever they happen to be.

194
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,640
举个例子 我非常喜欢 购物清单这个设置
As an example, I love the idea of a shopping list

195
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,470
当我走进商店的时候 就自动打开了
that automatically comes up as I get into the store

196
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,030
在我离开的时候 可能还会发送一个通知关于
and, before I leave, maybe sends me a notification of any items

197
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,690
我可能遗漏的事情
I might have missed.

198
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,980
就象这样 在用户要求之前
In this case, we're providing information to the user

199
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,090
我们就向他们提供
before they have to ask because we're

200
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,890
因为我们考虑到了他们所处的场景
taking into account their context for them, which

201
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,690
这让我想到这一点
leads me to this idea.

202
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,900
用户体验要求非常迅速 迅速到即时的程度
The experience should be so fast that it should feel immediate.

203
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,610
情景模式可以做到这一点
Now, being contextual can help with this.

204
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,630
不过这还是微交互方面的
But it's also about micro-interactions.

205
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,140
记住你不是打断和占用用户
Remember that you're not trying to distract and occupy

206
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,190
the user.

207
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,260
你只是在恰当的时候提供恰当的信息
You want to present just the right information

208
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,530
让用户可以得到想要的
right away so they can get what they need

209
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,750
还不影响他们的正常生活
and keep living their lives.

210
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,780
一个很好的例子就是Android TV上的语音搜索
A great example of this is Voice Search on Android TV.

211
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,720
用户说他们想看什么
The user can say what show they want to watch.

212
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,880
任何设置了搜索的应用
And any app that's set up for search

213
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,730
就会启动他们想看的
can launch that content for them.

214
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,370
还有一个就是
Another great example is Auto Play and queuing

215
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,670
Google Cast上的自动播放和排队
on Google Cast.

216
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,020
下一集可以立即播放
The next episode can just come right on

217
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,630
用户不需要停下来
so the user doesn't have to stop and find it

218
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,400
在他们看得正high的时候
when they're binge watching.

219
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,930
就像我周末那样
I do on the weekends.

220
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,060
最后一个 扩展性
The last thing is extensible.

221
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
你想要构建你的应用
And you're going to want to build your app

222
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,630
和体验 尽可能的可扩展
and experience to be as extensible as possible.

223
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,010
未来的用户会希望
Where are the places that your user will want

224
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,760
用户服务在哪些地方呢
to user service in the future?

225
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,980
你怎么才能把它加进你的核心应用
And how can you build that into your core app

226
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,040
让用户有需要的时候能够
now so that the overall experience that the user has

227
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,600
随时随地的看到所有的体验
is in hand whenever and wherever it makes sense for them?

228
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,410
就是这样
So those are them.

229
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,750
举个例子 音乐
Oh, an example of this-- music.

230
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,120
我想在任何时候 我想听音乐了
I love listening to music wherever I want.

231
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,630
就会播放 每个人都希望这样
And it turns out, I think, everybody's that way.

232
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,460
可能是待在卧室里
That might be at home in the living room.

233
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,860
可能是外出 在跑步或在车里
That might be on the go while I'm on a run or in the car.

234
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,920
现在 几个原则
So there you are-- a handful of principles

235
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,880
帮助你重新定义你的用户体验设计
to help you refine the design of your user experience

236
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,330
帮助你有效地获取用户
and reach your users in an undeniably useful way.

237
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,220
真的有效
That's really key.

238
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,890
我们发现当和开发者们一起工作的时候
We found when working with developers

239
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,990
这些指导方针很有用
that these guidelines help the most when working with new form

240
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,060
当开发新的功能
factors, understanding right away how

241
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,650
理解 描述你的工作
to contextualize and measure your work for success.

242
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,330
这也是我们为什么创造了 设计冲刺技术
And that's why we created a design sprint technique

243
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,940
用来学习实际开发新功能的设计原则
for learning the design principles for new form factors

244
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,220
in particular.

245
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,620
关于设计冲刺的材料
The material for one of these design sprints

246
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,410
我们昨天早上刚刚公布在了
was just launched yesterday morning

247
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,190
developers.google.com上
on developers.google.com.

248
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,320
许多来得早的朋友可能会在座位上
And many of you who arrived a session early

249
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,150
看到一个指南
may have found a play book on your seat.

250
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,670
设计冲刺
Design sprints are a great way to learn immediately

251
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,930
and to try out design principles for these new form factors.

252
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,087
然后你们可以应用在自己的项目中
And then you can apply them to your own project

253
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,420
因为已经非常熟悉了
with the comfort of familiarity.

254
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,870


255
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,550
好的
All right.

256
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,440
看一下具体的方案
Let's look at a practical solution, shall we?

257
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,990
一个你可以下载 编译 修改
One that you can download, compile, adjust,

258
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,050
同时能学到点东西的方案
and learn from.

259
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,370
一段简单的代码通常只能展示出一个具体方案的一小部分
A sample code usually just shows you a narrow view

260
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,630
这很好
at a partial solution, which is great

261
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,210
如果你想要了解它如何工作的
if you want to know just how one thing works.

262
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,550
如果你想了解细节部分的话
However, when you want to see how everything fits together,

263
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,882
你就需要一个完整功能的示例
you need a fully functioning example.

264
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:19,840
对于搭建跨平台应用来说 这非常重要
And this is particularly important for building

265
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,050
因为各个部分如何很好的协作
across devices because how everything fits together

266
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,430
就是它本身
is the thing.

267
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,820
为此 我们最近发布了一个简单但是功能完整的app
And we recently released a simple but complete app just

268
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,280
for this purpose.

269
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,855
它不只是一个你可以搭建的
This is not the only kind of thing

270
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:33,650
随处可见的应用
that you can build to be ubiquitous.

271
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,430
记住这一点
Remember that.

272
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,560
他是一个一类app的概览
But rather, it's just a look at one kind of app

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,490
还有如何搭建这样一个应用
and how it can be built with these ideas in mind.

274
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,254
通用 Android 音乐 播放器
The universal Android Music Player.

275
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,420
还记得我刚刚说的随时随地听音乐吗
Remember I was just talking about listening to music

276
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,280
everywhere?

277
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,250
这个app能帮你实现
This app helps you do that.

278
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:56,160
他可以在你的手机上，手表上，电视机上
And it works on your phone, your watch, your television--

279
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,950
不管是Google Cast还是后边的Android TV，当然 还有车上
both Android TV soon and Google Cast-- and of course, your car.

280
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,750
同时也开源在Github上
And it's completely open source on GitHub.

281
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,490
这是链接
There's the URL.

282
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,231


283
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,980
比方说你现在有一个多媒体app
Now, let's say you have a media app that's

284
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,410
在一个Activity上构建
built around an activity.

285
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,430
这很常见
This is pretty common.

286
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,200
这对于单设备 单应用是足够的
And that was just fine for an app on a device.

287
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,660
但是如果你想支持更多的设备
But if you want to support more devices, what you usually do

288
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,800
你想到的可能是扩展这个Activity
is you either expand that activity,

289
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,290
或者为每一种设备开发一个新的
or you create new ones for each new device.

290
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,620
这也不算糟 直到你意识到
That's still not so bad until you realize that you probably

291
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,880
你得回顾你的设计
have to revisit your app's overall design each

292
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,070
每次调整消息传递 播放锁 
and every time to coordinate new message passing, play

293
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,930
诸如此类的
locks, and that kind of thing.

294
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,220
现在 你可以实现一个稳定的核心服务
Instead, you're going to want a solid core central service that

295
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,670
可以轻松扩展每个新功能
extends easily to each new form factor.

296
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,260
有一个Android API可以实现这个
There's an Android API that makes this straightforward.

297
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,640
UAMP 是基于媒体浏览服务 和 媒体回话 构建的
UAMP is built around this media browser service and media

298
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,400
session.

299
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,470
这是一种你可以在Lollopop上搭建你的应用
So this is a way that you would build your app on Lollipop

300
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,060
你可以让你的播放器后台播放
so that you could have media keep playing in the background,

301
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,060
在锁屏状态下操作 等等
be controlled from the lock screen, and so forth.

302
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,520
也可以实现让多设备
It's also a great way to allow multiple devices

303
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,880
像核心服务的用户一样运行
to act as consumers of a central service

304
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,124
而不是Activity上的所有东西
rather than everything built in activities that need

305
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:17,290
都需要单独配置
to independently coordinate.

306
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,220


307
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,430
媒体浏览服务持有所有媒体资源的树结构
The media browser service maintains a tree structure

308
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,860
比如一个音乐列表
of all your media, such as a collection of music.

309
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,290
可以在本地传输和存储
And this could be either streamed or stored locally.

310
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,950
媒体回话记录你的应用
Media Session tracks the current state

311
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,200
正在播放什么
of what your app is playing.

312
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,160
有趣的是
Now, here's where it gets interesting.

313
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,350
所有的东西 不管是手机app
Everything, whether it's your phone app,

314
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,730
Android TV Android Auto
Android TV, Android Auto-- they're

315
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,960
都是媒体浏览服务和媒体会话的客户
all consumers of the Media Browser Service and Media

316
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,840
Session.

317
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,620
比如你的手机和
Let's say you've got your phone hooked up

318
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,160
Android Auto绑定了
to Android Auto like this.

319
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,710
左边那个app
So the companion app on the left, that's

320
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,640
也就是Android Auto端应用
the Android Auto Companion app.

321
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,170
这个app负责绘制用户界面
And that app is responsible for drawing the user interface

322
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,660
在车载终端上显示图像
and sending those pixels to the vehicle display.

323
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,010
同时 链接到媒体浏览服务
This app also connects to the Media Browser Service.

324
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,970
向服务发送查询请求
And it queries it to get the tree structure

325
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,280
以获得你的app的媒体库的树结构
of your apps media library.

326
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,940
车主通过触屏或者语音搜索
The driver of the car then selects the song,

327
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,630
切歌
either the touch screen or through voice search,

328
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,390
然后Android Auto就会通过媒体会话
and then Android Auto will use Media Session

329
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,560
运行回调函数
to run your callbacks.

330
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,810
这在Android Auto上非常棒 因为作为开发者
And this is great on Android Auto because as a developer,

331
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,010
你再也不用担心如何才让用户接口
you never have to worry about the details of making

332
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,980
在驾驶期间更安全
a user interface that's safe for driving.

333
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,270
Android把这些都做好了
Android Auto takes care of all of that for you.

334
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,710
只需要一个可访问的音乐服务 用来传输数据
It just needs the music service available to get the data

335
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,460
和控制回调
and handle playback.

336
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,900
左边这个app 还可以是别的东西
And the app on the left, it could be anything.

337
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,360
可以是Android Wear
It could be Android Wear .

338
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,530
可以是你某个app上的一个Activity
It could be just another activity in your same app

339
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,110
这个app同时操作Android TV
handling Android TV.

340
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,380
或者是Google Cast
Or maybe it's handling Google Cast.

341
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,660
这些都行 以为他的设置机制
Any of these will work because of how it's set up.

342
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,880
我们不需要每次添加一个新功能的时候
We don't have to rewire the app each and every time we

343
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,370
都要去做适配
add a new form factor.

344
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,060
相反 我们有了这个稳定的中央服务
Instead, we have this solid central service

345
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,480
可以轻松的扩展任何功能
that extends easily to each new form factor.

346
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,400
你只需要简单地访问音乐服务
You simply access the music service

347
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,424
为任何上下文为你的用户
for any context that makes sense for your user.

348
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:13,840
回想一下我之前说的
Now, remember what I said earlier.

349
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,080
这当然不是惟一的方式
This is certainly not the only way

350
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,460
实现通用app 或者惟一的有用的通用app
to make a ubiquitous app or the only ubiquitous app that

351
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,380
makes sense.

352
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,810
他给你提供了一个想法
It simply gives you an idea of how

353
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,140
如何构建一个高扩展性的应用
to structure a common app such as a music

354
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,210
比如一个音乐播放器
player for extensibility.

355
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,410
你是用的定制的API
The specific APIs you use are of course

356
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,440
完全取决于你的实际情况
going to depend on your use case,

357
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,330
你如何实现我们谈到的最佳实践
how you implement the best practices we talked about,

358
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,909
还有你的model和controller放在哪
and where you keep your model and your controller.

359
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:35,950
可能在手机终端
It could be on the phone.

360
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,070
也可能在云上
It could be in the cloud.

361
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,320
可以在任何有必要的地方
It could be wherever that make sense for your service.

362
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,670


363
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,420
我们来看一下一些可参考的例子
Let's take a look at a few examples of apps

364
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,450
用户可以使用的
shipped and available to users that are

365
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,420
在今天做这样的事的
doing this kind of thing today.

366
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,600
iHeartRadio 为用户提供广播 音乐 新闻 博客 体育
iHeartRadio-- it brings radio, music, news, podcasts, sports,

367
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,220
等等
and more to users.

368
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,432
你甚至可以建立你自己的频道
And you can even make your own custom stations.

369
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,140
使用非常方便
It's easy to use.

370
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,723
也是免费的
And it's free.

371
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:01,860
我很喜欢这个app
I love this app.

372
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,790
最重要的一点 也是我最喜欢的地方
And best of all-- my favorite thing--

373
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,350
我可以随时随地使用它
it's available wherever I go.

374
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,510
在Android Wear上
It's on Android Wear.

375
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,110
在Android TV上
You can Cast to your TV.

376
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,650
甚至是在车上
You can even use it in the car.

377
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,320


378
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,090
还有一个app WhatsApp
Another great app is WhatsApp messenger.

379
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,010
发送消息 照片
It's great for messaging, sending photos,

380
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,200
讨论组 等等等等
group chat, and a lot more.

381
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,110
很久之前在手机上就有这个app了
And it's been available for phones for a long while.

382
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,330
现在Android Wear和Android Auto上也有了
And it's also available on Android Wear and Android Auto.

383
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,950
你看懂这里的模式了吗
Do you see the pattern here?

384
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,190
这就是这些应用中的一个
This is one of those applications like music

385
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,340
你想随时随地使用的 比如音乐
where you expect it to work everywhere.

386
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,357
然后它做到了
And it does.

387
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,440
你可以顺着这个思路想想 
You can keep the conversation going whether you're

388
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,410
在你等电话接通的时候 散步的时候
waiting in line with your phone, on a walk with your watch,

389
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,150
或者开车的是时候
or a quick road trip with your car.

390
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,980


391
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,770
最后一个 食谱
And last, Cookbook.

392
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,310
旨在给用户带来烹饪的乐趣 和烹饪秘诀搜索
Cookbook aims to bring users the joy of cooking and sharing

393
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,130
记录烹饪时间 食材清单
with Recipe Search, calculated prep time, shopping

394
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,200
等等
list, and more.

395
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,800
如果你像我一样 常常把厨房弄得乱糟糟的
And if you're like me, you like to get everything as messy

396
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,300
这很好
in the kitchen as possible, which

397
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,110
因为他在任何我弄乱的地方都能使用
is great because it works on all the things I can get messy.

398
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,839
你可以用手机访问
It works on the phone.

399
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,740
也可以在手表 电视上查看你的食谱
You can also load your recipes up on your watch or your TV,

400
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,310
as well.

401
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,920
现在 如果你想把你的app做成像
Now, if you'd like to do with your app what these apps

402
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,260
这些app一样
have done.

403
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,150
可以在普适计算的课程中获取更多详细信息
you can find a lot more detail on the Ubiquitous Computing

404
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,780
这个课程几周内会在Udacity上开课
course that's launching on Udacity in the coming weeks.

405
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,420
这是Android Nano degree课程的一部分
It's part of the Android Nano degree.

406
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,880
很快就会上线
And it's going to be available very soon.

407
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,780
课程内容涵盖可穿戴设备 智能家居
It covers wearables, living room,

408
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,260
车载设备 这些我们今天提到的东西 不过更详细
and auto in much more detail than we talked about today.

409
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:39,436


410
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,810
讨论的时候
There's an old saying that I keep

411
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,990
我反复提到一点
coming back to when we're thinking about this space.

412
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,830
在构建应用的时候
Sometimes, when building apps-- and we're

413
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,040
 有时候 我们只见树木不见森林
all guilty of this-- we forget to see

414
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,880
简单地说 就是我们
the forest for the trees, which is to say,

415
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,900
太关注于我们眼前的问题
we get so focused on that one thing in front of us

416
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,630
忘记了我们实际上
that we forget that we're building

417
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,390
是在技术和用户在实际生活中建立联系
a relationship with the user across their lives,

418
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,500
across their technology.

419
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,450
为了实现这一点 我应该在任何用户需要的时候
And to be really valuable, we should be present in their life

420
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,460
提供我们的应用
whenever it makes sense to them.

421
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,150
为了实现这一点 我们应该在最开始的时候
To this end, we should build with ubiquity in mind

422
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,500
关注通用性 然后逐渐扩展新的东西
from the beginning and extend to new form factors over time.

423
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,472
要实现这些的需要的工具和设计知识
And the tools and design knowledge

424
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,180
已经有现成的了
that are required for this are available.

425
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,471
随手就能获取到
And they're at your fingertips.

426
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,450
我们只需要开始去做
We just need to get started.

427
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,110
然后我们就能知道我们能实现多远的未来
And then we're going to find out how much further we can go.

428
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,290
举个例子 Nest program的工作
For example, the Works with Nest program

429
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,965
已经让智能家居成为可能
is making the potential of the thoughtful home real.

430

433
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,190
从Android移植而来 能够在最小占用的
It's derived from Android and able to run on devices

434
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,490
设备上运行
with a minimal footprint.

435
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,740
核心功能包括网络连接
Core functionality includes connectivity

436
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,010
和模块管理
and scaled management.

437
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,080
当然 和昨天提到的Weave一起用的话
And of course, when you pair with Weave,

438
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,910
对普通用户来说 
also talked about yesterday, setup and discovery

439
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,540
安装和使用就很容易了
becomes effortless for the user.

440
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,860
所有设备都可以兼容
And devices can all be compatible

441
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,310
并且共同工作
and work with each other.

442
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,910


443
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,745
这是我们做的一项功能
This is the future of what we do.

444
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:05,870
我们应该携手并进
And we should get together.

445
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,620
继续讨论
And we should talk about it more.

446
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,459
今天宣布一下 我们的后续工作
So also announcing today, we're going to do just that.
